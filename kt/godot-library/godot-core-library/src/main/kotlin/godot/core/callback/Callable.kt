 * Callable is a built-in Variant type that represents a function.

 *
 * Like all Variant types, it can be stored in variables and passed to other functions. It is most commonly used for signal callbacks.
 *
 * This JVM version added an "unsafe" prefix to several methods. It's encouraged to use the typed version of those methods instead.
