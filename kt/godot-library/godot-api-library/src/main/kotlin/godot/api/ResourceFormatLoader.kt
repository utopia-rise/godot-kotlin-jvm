/**
 * Godot loads resources in the editor or in exported games using ResourceFormatLoaders. They are
 * queried automatically via the [ResourceLoader] singleton, or when a resource with internal
 * dependencies is loaded. Each file type may load as a different resource type, so multiple
 * ResourceFormatLoaders are registered in the engine.
 *
 * Extending this class allows you to define your own loader. Be sure to respect the documented
 * return types and values. You should give it a global class name with `class_name` for it to be
 * registered. Like built-in ResourceFormatLoaders, it will be called automatically when loading
 * resources of its handled type(s). You may also implement a [ResourceFormatSaver].
 *
 * **Note:** You can also extend [EditorImportPlugin] if the resource type you need exists but Godot
 * is unable to load its format. Choosing one way over another depends on if the format is suitable or
 * not for the final exported game. For example, it's better to import `.png` textures as `.ctex`
 * ([CompressedTexture2D]) first, so they can be loaded with better efficiency on the graphics card.
