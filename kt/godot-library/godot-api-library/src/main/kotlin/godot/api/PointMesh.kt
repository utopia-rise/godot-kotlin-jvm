/**
 * A [PointMesh] is a primitive mesh composed of a single point. Instead of relying on triangles,
 * points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to
 * be used with particle systems, but can also be used as a cheap way to render billboarded sprites
 * (for example in a point cloud).
 *
 * In order to be displayed, point meshes must be used with a material that has a point size. The
 * point size can be accessed in a shader with the `POINT_SIZE` built-in, or in a [BaseMaterial3D] by
 * setting the [BaseMaterial3D.usePointSize] and [BaseMaterial3D.pointSize] properties.
 *
 * **Note:** When using point meshes, properties that normally affect vertices will be ignored,
 * including [BaseMaterial3D.billboardMode], [BaseMaterial3D.grow], and [BaseMaterial3D.cullMode].
