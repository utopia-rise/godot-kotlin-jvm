/**
 * A Spotlight is a type of [Light3D] node that emits lights in a specific direction, in the shape
 * of a cone. The light is attenuated through the distance. This attenuation can be configured by
 * changing the energy, radius and attenuation parameters of [Light3D].
 *
 * **Note:** When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each
 * mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 spot lights on a single mesh resource will result
 * in spot lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering
 * method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be
 * increased by adjusting [ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/maxLightsPerObject].
 *
 * **Note:** When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights will only
 * correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to
 * deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, [GeometryInstance3D.extraCullMargin]
 * must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.

   *
   * **Note:** Setting attenuation to `2.0` or higher may result in distant objects receiving
   * minimal light, even within range. For example, with a range of `4096`, an object at `100` units is
