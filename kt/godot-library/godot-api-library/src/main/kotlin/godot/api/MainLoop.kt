/**
 * [MainLoop] is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by
 * [SceneTree], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also
 * possible to write and use one's own [MainLoop] subclass instead of the scene tree.
 *
 * Upon the application start, a [MainLoop] implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise,
 * the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneTree] is created) unless a
 * [MainLoop] [Script] is provided from the command line (with e.g. `godot -s my_loop.gd`) or the
 * [ProjectSettings.application/run/mainLoopType] project setting is overwritten.
 *
 * Here is an example script implementing a simple [MainLoop]:
 *
 * ```gdscript
 * //gdscript
 * class_name CustomMainLoop
 * extends MainLoop
 *
 * var time_elapsed = 0
 *
 * func _initialize():
 * print("Initialized:")
 * print("  Starting time: &#37;s" &#37; str(time_elapsed))
 *
 * func _process(delta):
 * time_elapsed += delta
 * # Return true to end the main loop.
 * return Input.get_mouse_button_mask() != 0 || Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE)
 *
 * func _finalize():
 * print("Finalized:")
 * print("  End time: &#37;s" &#37; str(time_elapsed))
 * ```
 *
 * ```csharp
 * //csharp
 * using Godot;
 *
 * [GlobalClass]
 * public partial class CustomMainLoop : MainLoop
 * {
 * private double _timeElapsed = 0;
 *
 * public override void _Initialize()
 * {
 * GD.Print("Initialized:");
 * GD.Print($"  Starting Time: {_timeElapsed}");
 * }
 *
 * public override bool _Process(double delta)
 * {
 * _timeElapsed += delta;
 * // Return true to end the main loop.
 * return Input.GetMouseButtonMask() != 0 || Input.IsKeyPressed(Key.Escape);
 * }
 *
 * private void _Finalize()
 * {
 * GD.Print("Finalized:");
 * GD.Print($"  End Time: {_timeElapsed}");
 * }
 * }
 * ```
