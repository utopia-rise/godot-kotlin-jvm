/**
 * Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics.
 *
 * Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics. It is made out of segments and is optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. However, it is not advised to use for [godot.RigidBody2D] nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions.
 *
 * The main difference between a [godot.ConvexPolygonShape2D] and a [godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D] is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.
 *
 * **Warning:** Using this shape for an [godot.Area2D] (via a [godot.CollisionShape2D] node) may give unexpected results: the area will only detect collisions with the segments in the [godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D] (and not with any "inside" of the shape, for example).
