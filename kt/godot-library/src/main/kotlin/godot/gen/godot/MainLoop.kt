/**
 * Abstract base class for the game's main loop.
 *
 * [godot.MainLoop] is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by [godot.SceneTree], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own [godot.MainLoop] subclass instead of the scene tree.
 *
 * Upon the application start, a [godot.MainLoop] implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [godot.SceneTree] is created) unless a [godot.MainLoop] [godot.Script] is provided from the command line (with e.g. `godot -s my_loop.gd` or the "Main Loop Type" project setting is overwritten.
 *
 * Here is an example script implementing a simple [godot.MainLoop]:
 *
 * [codeblocks]
 *
 * [gdscript]
 *
 * class_name CustomMainLoop
 *
 * extends MainLoop
 *
 *
 *
 * var time_elapsed = 0
 *
 *
 *
 * func _initialize():
 *
 *     print("Initialized:")
 *
 *     print("  Starting time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))
 *
 *
 *
 * func _process(delta):
 *
 *     time_elapsed += delta
 *
 *     # Return true to end the main loop.
 *
 *     return Input.get_mouse_button_mask() != 0 || Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_ESCAPE)
 *
 *
 *
 * func _finalize():
 *
 *     print("Finalized:")
 *
 *     print("  End time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))
 *
 * [/gdscript]
 *
 * [csharp]
 *
 * using Godot;
 *
 * using System;
 *
 *
 *
 * public class CustomMainLoop : MainLoop
 *
 * {
 *
 *     public float TimeElapsed = 0;
 *
 *
 *
 *     public override void _Initialize()
 *
 *     {

 *

 *
 *
 *
 *     public override bool _Process(float delta)
 *
 *     {
 *
 *         TimeElapsed += delta;
 *
 *         // Return true to end the main loop.
 *
 *         return Input.GetMouseButtonMask() != 0 || Input.IsKeyPressed((int)KeyList.Escape);
