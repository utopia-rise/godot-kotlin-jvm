/**
 * A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple [Thread]s, and
 * is equivalent to a binary [Semaphore]. It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical
 * section at a time.
 * This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread, provided
 * it also unlocks it as many times.
 * **Warning:** Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.
 * **Warning:** To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, the following conditions must
 * be met:
 * - When a [Mutex]'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads
 * (including the one on which the destruction will happen) must have it locked.
 * - When a [Thread]'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not have
 * any mutex locked.
