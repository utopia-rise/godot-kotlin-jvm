/**
 * Binary choice user interface widget. See also [godot.CheckButton].
 *
 * A checkbox allows the user to make a binary choice (choosing only one of two possible options). It's similar to [godot.CheckButton] in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use CheckBox when toggling it has **no** immediate effect on something. For example, it could be used when toggling it will only do something once a confirmation button is pressed.
 *
 * See also [godot.BaseButton] which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.
