/**
 * Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting
 * in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement
 * that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.
 * A tree of nodes is called a *scene*. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instantiated into
 * other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot
 * projects.
 * **Scene tree:** The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the
 * scene tree, it receives the [NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [_enterTree] callback is
 * triggered. Child nodes are always added *after* their parent node, i.e. the [_enterTree] callback of
 * a parent node will be triggered before its child's.
 * Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [NOTIFICATION_READY]
 * notification and their respective [_ready] callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the
 * [_ready] callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent
 * nodes.
 * This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the
 * callbacks: [_enterTree] of the parent, [_enterTree] of the children, [_ready] of the children and
 * finally [_ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).
 * **Processing:** Nodes can override the "process" state, so that they receive a callback on each
 * frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback [_process], toggled
 * with [setProcess]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing
 * time *delta* (in seconds) is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback [_physicsProcess],
 * toggled with [setPhysicsProcess]) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is
 * useful for code related to the physics engine.
 * Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [_input] function will be called for each
 * input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple
 * projects), and the [_unhandledInput] function might be preferred; it is called when the input event
 * was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), ensuring that the node only
 * receives the events that were meant for it.
 * To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instantiating scenes into other scenes), an
 * "owner" can be set for the node with the [owner] property. This keeps track of who instantiated
 * what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.
 * Finally, when a node is freed with [Object.free] or [queueFree], it will also free all its
 * children.
 * **Groups:** Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could
 * create groups like "enemies" or "collectables" for example, depending on your game. See
 * [addToGroup], [isInGroup] and [removeFromGroup]. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups,
 * iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on [SceneTree].
 * **Networking with nodes:** After connecting to a server (or making one, see
 * [ENetMultiplayerPeer]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to
 * communicate over the network. By calling [rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in
 * all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which
 * node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] (make sure node names are the same on all
 * peers). Also, take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.
 * **Note:** The `script` property is part of the [Object] class, not [Node]. It isn't exposed like
 * most properties but does have a setter and getter (see [Object.setScript] and [Object.getScript]).
