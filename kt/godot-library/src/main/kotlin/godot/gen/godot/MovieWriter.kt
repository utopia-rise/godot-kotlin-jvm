/**
 * Godot can record videos with non-real-time simulation. Like the `--fixed-fps`
 * [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html]command line argument[/url], this forces
 * the reported `delta` in [Node.Process] functions to be identical across frames, regardless of how
 * long it actually took to render the frame. This can be used to record high-quality videos with
 * perfect frame pacing regardless of your hardware's capabilities.
 * Godot has 2 built-in [MovieWriter]s:
 * - AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio (`.avi` file extension). Lossy
 * compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by
 * changing [ProjectSettings.editor/movieWriter/mjpegQuality]. The resulting file can be viewed in most
 * video players, but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with
 * [VideoStreamPlayer]. MJPEG does not support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file
 * of 4 GB in size at most.
 * - PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio (`.png` file extension). Lossless compression,
 * large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as
 * [url=https://ffmpeg.org/]FFmpeg[/url] after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, even
 * if the root viewport is set to be transparent.
 * If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-party software, you
 * can extend the [MovieWriter] class to create your own movie writers. This should typically be done
 * using GDExtension for performance reasons.
 * **Editor usage:** A default movie file path can be specified in
 * [ProjectSettings.editor/movieWriter/movieFile]. Alternatively, for running single scenes, a
 * `movie_file` metadata can be added to the root node, specifying the path to a movie file that will
 * be used when recording that scene. Once a path is set, click the video reel icon in the top-right
 * corner of the editor to enable Movie Maker mode, then run any scene as usual. The engine will start
 * recording as soon as the splash screen is finished, and it will only stop recording when the engine
 * quits. Click the video reel icon again to disable Movie Maker mode. Note that toggling Movie Maker
 * mode does not affect project instances that are already running.
 * **Note:** MovieWriter is available for use in both the editor and exported projects, but it is
 * *not* designed for use by end users to record videos while playing. Players wishing to record
 * gameplay videos should install tools such as [url=https://obsproject.com/]OBS Studio[/url] or
 * [url=https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/]SimpleScreenRecorder[/url] instead.
