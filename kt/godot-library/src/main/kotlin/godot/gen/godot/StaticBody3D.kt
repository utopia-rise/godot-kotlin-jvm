/**
 * A 3D physics body that can't be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it doesn't affect other bodies in its path.

 * Tutorials:
 * [https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/676](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/676)
 *
 * A static 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, [godot.AnimationPlayer]s (with [godot.AnimationPlayer.playbackProcessMode] set to `ANIMATION_PROCESS_PHYSICS`), and [godot.RemoteTransform3D].
 *
 * When [godot.StaticBody3D] is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use [godot.AnimatableBody3D] instead.
 *
 * [godot.StaticBody3D] is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using [constantLinearVelocity] and [constantAngularVelocity]).
