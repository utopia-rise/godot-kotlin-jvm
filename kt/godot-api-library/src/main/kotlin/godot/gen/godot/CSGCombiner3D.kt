/**
 * For complex arrangements of shapes, it is sometimes needed to add structure to your CSG nodes.
 * The CSGCombiner3D node allows you to create this structure. The node encapsulates the result of the
 * CSG operations of its children. In this way, it is possible to do operations on one set of shapes
 * that are children of one CSGCombiner3D node, and a set of separate operations on a second set of
 * shapes that are children of a second CSGCombiner3D node, and then do an operation that takes the two
 * end results as its input to create the final shape.
 * **Note:** CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a
 * significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance3D] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a CSG
 * node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during
 * gameplay.
