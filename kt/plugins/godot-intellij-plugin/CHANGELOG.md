# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Experimental

- Registration inspections and declaration highlighting are currently experimental.

### Added

- Added project-wide selection of the Explicit, Inferred, and Automatic registration modes. Registration inspections follow the selected mode for Kotlin, Java,
  and Scala.
- Added subtle declaration-line highlighting inside Godot scripts: orange for declarations that cannot be registered, blue for registration candidates, and
  green for registered declarations.
- Added a project setting to show or hide registration highlights. Highlights are enabled by default.
- Added a missing-parameterless-constructor error for concrete registered classes while allowing abstract Godot classes to omit one.
- Added complete descriptions for the Java, Kotlin, and Scala registration inspections.

### Improved

- Registration checks for classes, properties, signals, functions, lifecycle methods, and annotations now match the behavior of each registration mode.
- Corrected inspection severities so registration errors and advisory warnings are reported appropriately.
- Expanded Java and Scala inspections for shared class and function registration rules.
- Improved compatibility with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1, 2025.2, and 2026.1.

### Fixed

- Fixed registration highlights not appearing in the editor.
- Fixed registration highlight ranges so they cover only declaration signatures, excluding indentation, bodies, initializers, and delegates.
- Fixed duplicate custom Godot class names so both declarations are reported and results update immediately after editing or renaming either name.
- Fixed stale duplicate-name highlights and an IDE error that could occur while renaming a duplicate registered class name.
