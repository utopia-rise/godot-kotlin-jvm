/**
 * [CheckBox] allows the user to choose one of only two possible options. It's similar to
 * [CheckButton] in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX
 * patterns, it's recommended to use [CheckBox] when toggling it has **no** immediate effect on
 * something. For example, it could be used when toggling it will only do something once a confirmation
 * button is pressed.
 * See also [BaseButton] which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.
 * When [BaseButton.buttonGroup] specifies a [ButtonGroup], [CheckBox] changes its appearance to
 * that of a radio button and uses the various `radio_*` theme properties.
