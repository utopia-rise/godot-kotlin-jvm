/**
 * The [XRAnchor3D] point is an [XRNode3D] that maps a real world location identified by the AR
 * platform to a position within the game world. For example, as long as plane detection in ARKit is
 * on, ARKit will identify and update the position of planes (tables, floors, etc.) and create anchors
 * for them.
 * This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique ID. When you receive a signal that a
 * new anchor is available, you should add this node to your scene for that anchor. You can predefine
 * nodes and set the ID; the nodes will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognized.
 * Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing and orientation of an
 * anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns more about the real world out there especially
 * if only part of the surface is in view.
