/**
 * A WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. Provides an interface to
 * connect, maintain and monitor the connection.
 * Setting up a WebRTC connection between two peers may not seem a trivial task, but it can be
 * broken down into 3 main steps:
 * - The peer that wants to initiate the connection (`A` from now on) creates an offer and send it
 * to the other peer (`B` from now on).
 * - `B` receives the offer, generate and answer, and sends it to `A`).
 * - `A` and `B` then generates and exchange ICE candidates with each other.
 * After these steps, the connection should become connected. Keep on reading or look into the
 * tutorial for more information.
