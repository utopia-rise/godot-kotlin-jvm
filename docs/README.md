## Godot-JVM documentation

The bindings documentation is written in markdown files, using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Run locally

To locally run a web server that showcases the HTML version of the compiled markdown files, execute the following steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `docs` directory from the project's root.
3. Execute these commands:

```shell
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
The script will install the necessary Python dependencies within a virtual environment.
