**Godot Kotlin/JVM** is a Godot module which allows you to write your game or application logic in Kotlin on the JVM.

If you are looking for the documentation for Godot Kotlin/Native; you can find it [here](https://godot-kotlin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## State

This project is in alpha, it is by no means production ready.

### What's not working

The items in this list are explicitly mentioned here as these will be implemented in future versions.
Also consider the [API Differences](user-guide/api-differences.md) section for general differences
and limitations which will not be or cannot be adressed in the near forseable future or ever.

- Each registered constructor must have a unique number of arguments, constructor overloading is not yet supported.
- No tool mode (you can set it already in the `@RegisterClass` annotation but it has no effect yet).
- No plugin support, you cannot use Godot Kotlin/JVM to write plugins and addons yet.
- We support desktop OS (Linux, MacOS, Windows), Android and iOS.

### Bug reporting and questions

If you find bugs, please report an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm/issues) - but check for duplicates first. If you have questions or need help, you can ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zpb5Ru7v9x) in the `questions` and `help` channels respectively.
If you don't have Discord or you don't want to use it, please file an issue on GitHub.

## Supported languages

The main language supported is Kotlin. We do however support Java experimentally. It should be possible to support other JVM-based languages as well but this is not the focus of this project. If you want to have support for other languages, have a look at [support for other JVM-based languages](contribution/support-for-other-jvm-based-languages.md).

## Supported Kotlin version

This module relies on a Kotlin *compiler plugin* for registering your classes and members to Godot. As the compiler API from Kotlin is not stable yet, at the moment we can only support specific Kotlin version per release.

The current latest release is compatible with Kotlin version `1.9.23`.
