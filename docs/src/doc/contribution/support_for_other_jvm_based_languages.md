If you want to have support for other jvm based languages than Kotlin or Java, you'll have to fork the project. If you do and have questions, feel free to ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zpb5Ru7v9x). We're happy to help you out with this. 

Keep in mind however: this is no easy task and requires that the language, and it's tooling you want to implement has at least the following capabilities:

- Compile time annotation processing (or you need to register every class by hand)
- Java/Kotlin interop
