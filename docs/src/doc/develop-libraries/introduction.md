Godot-JVM libraries are basically the equivalent of Godot Addons,
but specifically for the use in other Godot-JVM projects like Games or Applications.

!!!Relevance
    If you build a library which does not register any classes to Godot, you can just create a regular JVM library, and you will have no need for this documentation.

## Overview

A Godot-JVM library is just a regular JVM library with additional metadata annotations for registered classes.
For registered classes in a library registration files are generated and provided to the consumer, so they can be used in the consuming project.
